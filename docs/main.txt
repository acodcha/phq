/// If you have ever made a unit conversion error, or if you have ever asked yourself questions such as "what is the correct unit of mass density in the foot-pound-second system?", "how do I compute a stress field given a strain field?", or "what is a slug unit?", then this library is for you!
///
/// - Physical quantities have no memory overhead compared to using raw floating-point numbers to represent the same data.
/// - Mathematical operations between physical quantities have no runtime overhead compared to using raw floating-point numbers to perform the same operations.
/// - Unit conversions are handled automatically when physical quantities are constructed, so physical quantities are guaranteed to always be in a consistent state. No more unit conversion errors!
/// - Physical models enable tedious mathematical computations involving physical quantities to be performed easily. No more tensor-vector multiplication errors when computing stresses!
/// - Unit systems allow scientific data to be expressed in several consistent systems of units for use across applications. Never again will you accidentally use pounds when you should have used slugs!

///
/// \subsection usage_basics Usage: Basics
///
/// Physical quantities are constructed from a value and a unit and support standard arithmetic operations. For example:
///
/// ```
/// PhQ::Temperature low{10.0, PhQ::Unit::Temperature::Celsius};
/// PhQ::Temperature high{68.0, PhQ::Unit::Temperature::Fahrenheit};
/// PhQ::Temperature average = 0.5 * (low + high);
/// std::cout << "Average: " << average.Print(PhQ::Unit::Temperature::Celsius) << std::endl;
/// // Average: 15.0000000000000000 °C
/// ```
///
/// The above example creates two temperature quantities, computes their average, and prints the result.
///
/// Physical quantities support the `float`, `double`, and `long double` floating-point number types. A physical quantity's type is inferred from its constructor arguments and can also be explicitly specified. If no type is explicitly specified and the default constructor is used, the `double` type is used by default. For example:
///
/// ```
/// // Defaults to PhQ::Area<double>.
/// PhQ::Area area_double;
///
/// // PhQ::Area<float> is inferred from the constructor argument.
/// PhQ::Area area_float{1.23F, PhQ::Unit::Area::Hectare};
///
/// // PhQ::Area<long double> is explicitly specified.
/// PhQ::Area<long double> area_long_double;
/// area_long_double = {4.56L, PhQ::Unit::Area::SquareFoot};
///
/// // Casts a PhQ::Area<long double> to a PhQ::Area<double>.
/// // The underlying value is cast from long double to double.
/// area_double = area_long_double;
/// ```
///
/// For performance reasons, physical quantities are constructed with uninitialized values by default. Alternatively, the `Zero()` static method can be used to zero-initialize a physical quantity. For example:
///
/// ```
/// PhQ::Angle<> angle;  // Uninitialized.
/// angle = {45.0, PhQ::Unit::Angle::Degree};
///
/// PhQ::MachNumber<> mach_number_zero = PhQ::MachNumber<>::Zero();
///
/// PhQ::Position<float> position_zero = PhQ::Position<float>::Zero();
/// ```
///
/// Physical quantities can be constructed statically with the `Create` static method. For example:
///
/// ```
/// constexpr PhQ::Power<float> power = PhQ::Power<float>::Create<PhQ::Unit::Power::Kilowatt>(5.0F);
/// std::cout << "Power: " << power << std::endl;
/// // Power: 5000.000000 W
/// ```
///
/// Physical quantities are implemented efficiently with no memory overhead compared to using raw floating-point numbers to represent the same data. For example:
///
/// ```
/// PhQ::Volume<double> volume{10.0, PhQ::Unit::Volume::Litre};
/// assert(sizeof(volume) == sizeof(double));
///
/// PhQ::Position<float> position{{-1.11F, 2.22F, -3.33F}, PhQ::Unit::Length::Mile};
/// assert(sizeof(position) == 3 * sizeof(float));
/// ```
///
/// The only circumstance in which the Physical Quantities library throws an exception is a memory allocation failure due to running out of memory on your system when instantiating a new C++ object. In this case, C++ throws a `std::bad_alloc` exception.
///
/// If maintaining a strong exception guarantee is a concern, use `try` and `catch` blocks when instantiating new objects to handle this exception. Other than this case, the Physical Quantities library does not throw exceptions. Where applicable, this library's functions and methods are marked `noexcept`.
///
/// \ref usage "(Back to Usage)"
///
/// \subsection usage_vectors_and_tensors Usage: Vectors and Tensors
///
/// Physical quantities' values can be scalars, vectors, or dyadic tensors. Vectors and dyadic tensors are defined in three-dimensional Euclidean space and use Cartesian coordinates. For example:
///
/// ```
/// PhQ::HeatFlux heat_flux{{-200.0,  // x
///                           300.0,  // y
///                          -600.0}, // z
///                         PhQ::Unit::EnergyFlux::WattPerSquareMetre};
/// heat_flux /= 7.0;
/// PhQ::ScalarHeatFlux magnitude = heat_flux.Magnitude();
/// std::cout << "Magnitude: " << magnitude.Print(PhQ::Unit::EnergyFlux::WattPerSquareMetre) << std::endl;
/// // Magnitude: 100.000000000000000 W/m^2
/// ```
///
/// The above example creates a heat flux of (-200, 300, -600) W/m^2, divides it by 7, computes its magnitude, and prints the magnitude in pounds, which results in 100 W/m^2.
///
/// Two-dimensional planar vectors in the XY plane are also supported. For example:
///
/// ```
/// PhQ::PlanarForce planar_force{{-300.0,  // x
///                                 400.0}, // y
///                               PhQ::Unit::Force::Pound};
/// planar_force *= 2.0;
/// PhQ::ScalarForce magnitude = planar_force.Magnitude();
/// std::cout << "Magnitude: " << magnitude.Print(PhQ::Unit::Force::Pound) << std::endl;
/// // Magnitude: 1000.00000000000000 lbf
/// ```
///
/// The above example creates a planar force of (-300, 400) lbf, doubles it, computes its magnitude, and prints the magnitude in pounds, which results in 1000 lbf.
///
/// The components of dyadic tensors are listed in alphabetical order: xx, xy, xz, yx, yy, yz, zx, zy, and zz. Some dyadic tensor physical quantities are symmetric while others are asymmetric. Symmetric dyadic tensors only need to specify their upper triangular components: xx, xy, xz, yy, yz, and zz. For example:
///
/// ```
/// PhQ::Stress stress{{32.0,  // xx
///                     -4.0,  // xy = yx
///                     -2.0,  // xz = zx
///                     16.0,  // yy
///                     -1.0,  // yz = zy
///                      8.0}, // zz
///                    PhQ::Unit::Pressure::Megapascal};
/// assert(stress.Value().xy() == stress.Value().yx());
/// std::cout << "Equivalent von Mises stress: " << stress.VonMises() << std::endl;
/// // Equivalent von Mises stress: 2.26053091109146290e+07 Pa
/// ```
///
/// The above example creates a stress quantity, asserts that it is symmetric, and computes and prints its equivalent von Mises stress.
///
/// \ref usage "(Back to Usage)"
///
/// \subsection usage_operations Usage: Operations
///
/// Meaningful arithmetic operations between different physical quantities are supported via operator overloading. Mathematical operations between physical quantities are implemented efficiently with no runtime overhead compared to using raw floating-point numbers to represent the same data. For example:
///
/// ```
/// PhQ::Velocity velocity{{50.0, -10.0, 20.0}, PhQ::Unit::Speed::MetrePerSecond};
/// PhQ::Time time{10.0, PhQ::Unit::Time::Second};
/// PhQ::Acceleration acceleration = velocity / time;
/// std::cout << "Acceleration: " << acceleration << std::endl;
/// // Acceleration: (5.00000000000000000, -1.00000000000000000, 2.00000000000000000) m/s^2
/// ```
///
/// The above example creates a velocity quantity of (50, -10, 20) m/s and a time quantity of 10 s, then divides the velocity by the time to produce an acceleration quantity of (5, -1, 2) m/s^2.
///
/// Similarly, other meaningful mathematical operations are supported via member methods. For example:
///
/// ```
/// PhQ::Displacement displacement{{0.0, 6.0, 0.0}, PhQ::Unit::Length::Inch};
/// PhQ::Length length = displacement.Magnitude();
/// PhQ::Direction direction = displacement.Direction();
/// std::cout << "Length and direction: " << length << " and " << direction << std::endl;
/// // Length and direction: 0.152399999999999980 m and (0, 1.00000000000000000, 0)
///
/// PhQ::Displacement other_displacement{{0.0, 0.0, -3.0}, PhQ::Unit::Length::Foot};
/// PhQ::Angle angle{displacement, other_displacement};
/// std::cout << "Angle: " << angle.Print(PhQ::Unit::Angle::Degree) << std::endl;
/// // Angle: 90.0000000000000000 deg
/// ```
///
/// The above example creates a displacement quantity of (0, 6, 0) in, computes and prints its magnitude and direction, then creates a second displacement of (0, 0, -3) ft, and computes and prints the angle between the two displacements, which is 90 deg.
///
/// The Physical Quantities library checks for divisions by zero in certain critical internal arithmetic operations. For example, `PhQ::Direction` carefully checks for the zero vector case when normalizing its magnitude, and `PhQ::Dyad` and `PhQ::SymmetricDyad` carefully check for a zero determinant when computing their inverse.
///
/// However, in general, divisions by zero can occur during arithmetic operations between physical quantities. For example, `PhQ::Length<>::Zero() / PhQ::Time<>::Zero()` results in a `PhQ::Speed` with a value of "not-a-number" (`NaN`). C++ uses the IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic standard such that divisions by zero result in `inf`, `-inf`, or `NaN`. If any of these special cases are a concern, use try-catch blocks or standard C++ utilities such as `std::isfinite`.
///
/// Similarly, floating-point overflows and underflows can occur during arithmetic operations between physical quantities. If this is a concern, query the status of the C++ floating-point environment with `std::fetestexcept`.
///
/// \ref usage "(Back to Usage)"
///
/// \subsection usage_units Usage: Units
///
/// The Physical Quantities library handles unit conversions automatically, and all unit conversions are exact to within floating-point arithmetic precision.
///
/// When a physical quantity object is constructed, its value is immediately converted to the standard unit of measure in the standard system of units: the metre-kilogram-second-kelvin (m·kg·s·K) system. This way, all physical quantities maintain their values in a consistent system of units. This approach greatly minimizes the number of unit conversions during program execution; when arithmetic operations are performed between physical quantities, no unit conversion is needed.
///
/// The only other instances where a physical quantity undergoes a unit conversion is when its value is expressed in a different unit of measure or when the physical quantity itself is printed as a string expressed in a different unit of measure. These cases are illustrated in the following examples.
///
/// A physical quantity's value can be expressed in any unit of measure through its `Value` method. For example:
///
/// ```
/// PhQ::Mass mass{10.0, PhQ::Unit::Mass::Pound};
///
/// double standard_value = mass.Value();
/// PhQ::Unit::Mass standard_unit = PhQ::Mass<>::Unit();
/// std::string_view standard_abbreviation = PhQ::Abbreviation(standard_unit);
/// std::cout << "Mass: " << standard_value << " " << standard_abbreviation << std::endl;
/// // Mass: 4.53592 kg
///
/// PhQ::Unit::Mass other_unit = PhQ::Unit::Mass::Gram;
/// std::string_view other_abbreviation = PhQ::Abbreviation(other_unit);
/// double other_value = mass.Value(other_unit);
/// std::cout << "Mass: " << other_value << " " << other_abbreviation << std::endl;
/// // Mass: 4535.92 g
/// ```
///
/// The above example creates a 10 lbm mass and prints its value as 4.535924 kg and 4535.924 g.
///
/// A physical quantity can be expressed in any unit of measure through its `Print` method. For example:
///
/// ```
/// PhQ::Frequency frequency{1234.56789, PhQ::Unit::Frequency::Hertz};
/// std::string standard = frequency.Print();
/// std::string kilohertz = frequency.Print(PhQ::Unit::Frequency::Kilohertz);
/// std::cout << "Frequency: " << standard << " = " << kilohertz << std::endl;
/// // Frequency: 1234.56789000000003 Hz = 1.23456789000000011 kHz
/// ```
///
/// The above example creates a 1234.56789 Hz frequency and prints it both in hertz and in kilohertz.
///
/// Unit conversions can also be performed explicitly on raw floating-point numbers without the use of physical quantities through the `PhQ::Convert`, `PhQ::ConvertInPlace`, and `PhQ::ConvertStatically` functions, which take one or more floating-point values, an original unit, and a new unit. For example:
///
/// ```
/// std::vector<double> values = {10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0};
/// PhQ::ConvertInPlace(values, PhQ::Unit::Energy::Joule, PhQ::Unit::Energy::FootPound);
/// for (const double value : values) {
///   std::cout << value << std::endl;
/// }
/// // 7.37562
/// // 14.7512
/// // 22.1269
/// // 29.5025
/// ```
///
/// The above example converts a collection of values from joules to foot-pounds. The same results can also be achieved using physical quantities instead of raw floating-point values. For example:
///
/// ```
/// const std::vector<PhQ::Energy<>> quantities = {
///     {10.0, PhQ::Unit::Energy::Joule},
///     {20.0, PhQ::Unit::Energy::Joule},
///     {30.0, PhQ::Unit::Energy::Joule},
///     {40.0, PhQ::Unit::Energy::Joule},
/// };
/// for (const PhQ::Energy<>& quantity : quantities) {
///   std::cout << quantity.Value(PhQ::Unit::Energy::FootPound) << std::endl;
/// }
/// // 7.37562
/// // 14.7512
/// // 22.1269
/// // 29.5025
/// ```
///
/// In general, when it comes to unit conversions, it is simpler to use the `Value` or `Print` member methods of physical quantities rather than to explicitly invoke conversion functions.
///
/// \ref usage "(Back to Usage)"
///
/// \subsection usage_unit_systems Usage: Unit Systems
///
/// Internally, physical quantities store their values in the metre-kilogram-second-kelvin (m·kg·s·K) system. Unit conversions are performed automatically when physical quantity objects are constructed. Other common systems of units of measure are also defined:
///
/// - Metre-kilogram-second-kelvin (m·kg·s·K) system
/// - Millimetre-gram-second-kelvin (mm·g·s·K) system
/// - Foot-pound-second-rankine (ft·lbf·s·°R) system
/// - Inch-pound-second-rankine (in·lbf·s·°R) system
///
/// Data can be expressed in the consistent units of any of these unit systems. The unit of measure of a given type that corresponds to a given system of units can be obtained with the `PhQ::ConsistentUnit` function. For example:
///
/// ```
/// PhQ::UnitSystem system = PhQ::UnitSystem::FootPoundSecondRankine;
/// PhQ::Unit::SpecificEnergy unit = PhQ::ConsistentUnit<PhQ::Unit::SpecificEnergy>(system);
/// std::cout << unit << std::endl;
/// // ft·lbf/slug
///
/// PhQ::SpecificEnergy specific_energy{10.0, PhQ::Unit::SpecificEnergy::JoulePerKilogram};
/// double value = specific_energy.Value(unit);
/// std::cout << value << std::endl;
/// // 107.639
/// ```
///
/// The above example creates a mass-specific energy quantity of 10 J/kg. Then, the mass-specific energy unit corresponding to the foot-pound-second-rankine (ft·lbf·s·°R) system is obtained, and the mass-specific energy value is expressed in this unit of measure.
///
/// Given a unit, it is also possible to obtain its related system of units, if any, with the `PhQ::RelatedUnitSystem` function. For example:
///
/// ```
/// PhQ::Unit::Mass unit = PhQ::Unit::Mass::Slug;
/// std::optional<PhQ::UnitSystem> optional_system = PhQ::RelatedUnitSystem(unit);
/// assert(optional_system.has_value());
/// std::cout << optional_system.value() << std::endl;
/// // ft·lbf·s·°R
/// ```
///
/// The above example obtains the system of units related to the slug mass unit, which is the foot-pound-second-rankine (ft·lbf·s·°R) system.
///
/// However, not all units of measure have a corresponding system of units. For example:
///
/// ```
/// PhQ::Unit::Mass unit = PhQ::Unit::Mass::Pound;
/// std::optional<PhQ::UnitSystem> optional_system = PhQ::RelatedUnitSystem(unit);
/// assert(!optional_system.has_value());

These seven independent base physical dimensions are: time (T), length (L), mass (M), electric current (I), temperature (Θ), amount of substance (N), and luminous intensity (J). Units of measure that share the same physical dimension set are of the same type and can be converted between one another.
///
/// For example, the metre per second and the mile per hour are both units of measure that have the same physical dimension set of T^(-1)·L, which is the physical dimension set of speed, so these two units of measure can be converted between one another.
///
/// On the other hand, the kilogram per cubic metre is a unit of measure with physical dimension set L^(-3)·M, which is the physical dimension set of mass density, so this unit of measure cannot be converted to either the metre per second or the mile per hour, which have a different physical dimension set.
///
/// The Physical Quantities library organizes units of measure into types, where each type roughly corresponds to a given physical dimension set.
///
/// The physical dimension set of a unit of measure can be obtained with the `PhQ::RelatedDimensions` global variable. For example:
///
/// ```
/// const PhQ::Dimensions dimensions = PhQ::RelatedDimensions<Unit::HeatCapacity>;
/// assert(dimensions.Time() == PhQ::Dimension::Time(-2));
/// assert(dimensions.Length() == PhQ::Dimension::Length(2));
/// assert(dimensions.Mass() == PhQ::Dimension::Mass(1));
/// assert(dimensions.ElectricCurrent() == PhQ::Dimension::ElectricCurrent(0));
/// assert(dimensions.Temperature() == PhQ::Dimension::Temperature(-1));
/// assert(dimensions.SubstanceAmount() == PhQ::Dimension::SubstanceAmount(0));
/// assert(dimensions.LuminousIntensity() == PhQ::Dimension::LuminousIntensity(0));
/// std::cout << "Dimensions: " << dimensions << std::endl;
/// // Dimensions: T^(-2)·L^2·M·Θ^(-1)
/// ```
///
/// The above example obtains the physical dimension set of heat capacity, which is T^(-2)·L^2·M·Θ^(-1).
///
/// The physical dimension set of a physical quantity is simply the physical dimension set of its unit of measure and can be obtained with the `Dimensions` method. For example:
///
/// ```
/// const PhQ::Dimensions dimensions = PhQ::MassDensity<>::Dimensions();
/// assert(dimensions.Time() == PhQ::Dimension::Time(0));
/// assert(dimensions.Length() == PhQ::Dimension::Length(-3));
/// assert(dimensions.Mass() == PhQ::Dimension::Mass(1));
/// assert(dimensions.ElectricCurrent() == PhQ::Dimension::ElectricCurrent(0));
/// assert(dimensions.Temperature() == PhQ::Dimension::Temperature(0));
/// assert(dimensions.SubstanceAmount() == PhQ::Dimension::SubstanceAmount(0));
/// assert(dimensions.LuminousIntensity() == PhQ::Dimension::LuminousIntensity(0));
/// std::cout << "Dimensions: " << dimensions << std::endl;
/// // Dimensions: L^(-3)·M
/// ```
///
/// The above example obtains the physical dimension set of mass density, which is L^(-3)·M.

/// Alternatively, the documentation can be built locally on your system. Doing so requires the following additional package:
///
/// - **Doxygen**: The Doxygen library (<https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>) is used for building documentation. On Ubuntu, install it with `sudo apt install doxygen`.
///
/// Clone the Physical Quantities library's repository and build its documentation with:
///
/// ```
/// git clone git@github.com:acodcha/phq.git PhQ
/// cd PhQ
/// doxygen Doxyfile
/// ```
///
/// This builds HTML documentation pages in the `PhQ/docs/html/` directory. Browse the documentation by opening the `PhQ/docs/html/index.html` file in a web browser.

///
/// \section installation Installation
///
/// If using the CMake build system, the Physical Quantities library can optionally be installed on your system to conveniently use it in your CMake projects. Alternatively, see the \ref configuration "Configuration" section for other methods of use.
///
/// Clone this library's repository, configure it, and install it with:
///
/// ```
/// git clone git@github.com:acodcha/phq.git PhQ
/// cd PhQ
/// mkdir build
/// cd build
/// cmake ..
/// sudo make install
/// ```
///
/// This is a header-only library, so no compilation is needed. On most systems, the above code installs this library's headers to `/usr/local/include/PhQ` and writes configuration files to `/usr/local/share/PhQ`. You can uninstall the library by simply deleting these directories.
///
/// \ref index "(Back to Top)"
///
/// \section testing Testing
///
/// The Physical Quantities library is automatically tested whenever it is updated.
///
/// Testing can optionally be performed locally on your system. Doing so requires the following additional package:
///
/// - **GoogleTest**: The GoogleTest library (<https://github.com/google/googletest>) is used for testing. On Ubuntu, install it with `sudo apt install libgtest-dev`. When testing is enabled, if the GoogleTest library is not found on your system, it is automatically downloaded and linked with this library.
///
/// Testing instructions differ depending on your build system.
///
/// If using the CMake build system, you can manually test the Physical Quantities library on your system with:
///
/// ```
/// git clone git@github.com:acodcha/phq.git PhQ
/// cd PhQ
/// mkdir build
/// cd build
/// cmake .. -DTEST_PHQ_LIBRARY=ON
/// make --jobs=16
/// make test
/// ```
///
/// If using the Bazel build system, you can manually test the Physical Quantities library on your system with:
///
/// ```
/// git clone git@github.com:acodcha/phq.git PhQ
/// cd PhQ
/// bazel build //:all
/// bazel test //:all
